    Sophia API

    Canonical Sophia OpenAPI contract for Project LOGOS. See Phase 2 specification (docs/architecture/PHASE2_SPEC.md) for behavioral details.  Sophia exposes planner and world-model endpoints backed by the Hybrid Cognitive Graph (HCG). Responses share the unified `CWMState` envelope so CLI, browser, and SDK clients consume identical data. 

    The version of the OpenAPI document: 0.2.0
    Generated by OpenAPI Generator (https://openapi-generator.tech)
