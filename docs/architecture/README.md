# Architecture Documentation

System-wide specs and milestone blueprints live here. These files replace the scattered `docs/spec/` and `docs/phase2/` references.

## Key References
- [LOGOS Flexible Spec](LOGOS_SPEC_FLEXIBLE.md) — living architecture and ontology narrative.
- [Phase 2 Specification](PHASE2_SPEC.md) — end-to-end requirements for perception, diagnostics, and dual Apollo surfaces.

## Related Material
Historical documents that still need consolidation (e.g., `docs/phase1/`, `docs/phase2/perception/`) should either be migrated here or linked from this README over time.
