# Demo Playbooks

Demo- and verification-specific guides live here. Each doc should include a status/progress block so teams know whether the workflow is still valid.

| Document | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [M4_DEMO_ASSETS.md](M4_DEMO_ASSETS.md) | ✅ Complete | Asset list + automation/scripts for Milestone 4 pick-and-place demo. |
| [PICK_AND_PLACE_WALKTHROUGH.md](PICK_AND_PLACE_WALKTHROUGH.md) | ✅ Complete | Step-by-step instructions for the same demo. |

When adding new demos (Phase 2+, perception scenarios, etc.) create a new markdown file here and update the table.
