# Reference Artifacts

This folder is a landing zone for generated or canonical artifacts (OpenAPI specs, SDK regeneration notes, schema exports). Link to files under `contracts/`, `sdk/`, or other repositories as needed.

Use it to document how to regenerate clients, where canonical contracts live, and how downstream repos should consume them.
