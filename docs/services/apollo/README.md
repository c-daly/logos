# Apollo Service Docs

Guides that apply specifically to the Apollo CLI/webapp live here.

## Files
- [Web Prototype Sprint Notes](WEB_PROTOTYPE_SPRINT.md) — development diary + backlog for the dual-surface prototype.

Future Apollo docs (diagnostics wiring, mock data instructions, etc.) should be added to this folder instead of scattered under `docs/phase2/`.
