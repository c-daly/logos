# Service Documentation

Each LOGOS component gets a subdirectory under `docs/services/`. Start with Apollo and add Sophia/Hermes/Talos entries as we consolidate their guides.

## Current folders
- [`apollo/`](apollo) — browser + CLI specifics (mock data, sprint notes).

When migrating service-specific docs from `docs/phase2` or other folders, move them into the relevant subdirectory here.
