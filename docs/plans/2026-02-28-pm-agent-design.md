# Project Management Agent — Design

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** Approved

## Problem

1. Ticket discipline breaks down because it requires manual effort to maintain
2. Ideas from sessions and code discoveries get lost without a capture mechanism
3. No living document that tracks where LOGOS is relative to its goals
4. No repeatable pipeline from idea to implemented code
5. Agents need context about project direction to make good design decisions

## Solution

A custom Claude Code agent (`.claude/agents/project-manager.md`) that acts as project manager. You interact with it as a stakeholder or senior engineer — it drafts, you approve. It owns the vision and status documents and shepherds ideas through the pipeline.

## The Pipeline

```
Vision goal
  → "What about this? Are we ready?"
  → PM agent assesses readiness (code, tests, infra, prerequisites)
  → If ready: spec the goal directly
  → If not ready: identify prerequisites, spec those first
  → Design doc in docs/plans/ (brainstorming flow)
  → You approve the design
  → Implementation tickets generated (writing-plans)
  → Agents implement
  → PM agent updates STATUS.md and VISION.md
```

Ideas also enter the pipeline from:
- Conversations with Claude (brainstorming sessions, work sessions)
- Agent discoveries (stale code, missing tests, architectural issues)
- Your notes and observations

These get captured as GitHub issues, and when enough related ideas cluster around a vision goal, the PM agent proposes a spec.

## Agent Modes

### 1. Status Update

Regenerate `docs/STATUS.md` by querying:
- GitHub issues, PRs, and project board across all 5 repos
- Recent merged PRs and closed issues
- Codebase state (what's actually implemented vs what tickets say)
- Output of `scripts/reconcile-issues.sh`

Produces a "you are here" snapshot organized against vision goals.

### 2. Idea Capture

You describe an idea (or the agent discovers one during work). Agent produces a well-formed GitHub issue with:
- Context / Objective / Acceptance Criteria / Notes (standard template)
- Proper labels from the canonical set
- Added to the project board with appropriate epic

### 3. Goal Assessment & Spec Generation

You point at a vision goal. Agent:
1. **Assesses readiness** — searches codebase, checks issues, evaluates what exists
2. **Identifies the path** — what's done, what's missing, what prerequisites need to come first
3. **Proposes next step** — either spec the goal itself, or spec a prerequisite
4. **Runs brainstorming flow** — clarify requirements, propose approaches, produce design doc
5. **Output** — design doc in `docs/plans/`, ready for writing-plans to generate tickets

### 4. Vision Review

Agent reviews `docs/VISION.md` against current status:
- Flags goals that are now achieved (or nearly so)
- Proposes new goals based on project trajectory
- Suggests priority reordering based on what's unblocked
- You approve or revise

## Documents

### VISION.md

`docs/VISION.md` — owned by PM agent, edited by you as needed.

Structure:
- **What LOGOS is** — one paragraph
- **Goals** — numbered, each with description and status (not started / in progress / achieved)
- **Non-goals** — what LOGOS isn't trying to be
- **Current priorities** — ordered list of what matters now

Intentionally short. Not architecture (that's `ARCHITECTURE.md`), not specs (those are in `docs/plans/`). Just direction and priorities.

### STATUS.md

`docs/STATUS.md` — regenerated by PM agent on request.

Structure:
- **Recent work** — last N merged PRs and closed issues, grouped by component
- **In flight** — open PRs and in-progress issues
- **Blocked** — issues with `status:blocked`
- **Progress against vision goals** — each goal with brief assessment
- **Stale/drift** — unlinked PRs, stale issues, reconciliation output

## Agent Definition

The agent is defined at `.claude/agents/project-manager.md`. It has access to:
- `gh` CLI (issues, PRs, project board)
- Glob, Grep, Read (codebase assessment)
- Bash (run reconciliation script, git log)
- `docs/VISION.md`, `docs/STATUS.md`, `docs/PROJECT_TRACKING.md`

It does NOT:
- Create or close issues without your confirmation
- Modify the vision doc without your approval
- Push code or merge PRs
- Make architectural decisions (it identifies them and escalates)

## What This Doesn't Cover (Yet)

- Automatic triggering (agent runs on demand, not on events)
- CI integration (no GitHub Actions component)
- Cross-session memory (agent reads docs each time, doesn't persist state beyond files)
- Proactive notifications (doesn't alert you to problems, you ask)

These can be added incrementally as the basic workflow proves out.
