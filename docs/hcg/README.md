# HCG & Continuous World Model Docs

This folder captures the Hybrid Cognitive Graph ontology, SHACL constraints, and working-memory schemas.

## Current docs
- [CWM State Contract Rollout](CWM_STATE_CONTRACT_ROLLOUT.md) — describes the unified `CWMState` envelope and rollout plan.

Upcoming work (see issue #288) will add dedicated references for CWM-A/G/E, capability catalogs, and fact schemas. Place all HCG-related specs here so backend and UI teams share one source of truth.
