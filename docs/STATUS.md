## In Flight

No open PRs across any repository. No issues labeled `status:in-progress`.

## Blocked

| Issue | Title | Blocked On |
|-------|-------|------------|
| logos #464 | Update M3 planning tests for flexible ontology | Upstream ontology work (#460, #461) |
| logos #463 | Validate M4 demo end-to-end with flexible ontology | Upstream ontology work (#460, #461) |

## Progress Against Vision Goals

### 1. Complete the cognitive loop -- STRONG MOMENTUM
The loop works end-to-end: Hermes extracts entities/relations, proposes edges, Sophia processes proposals into HCG, context enriches LLM responses. A major performance sprint landed (batching, parallelization, async processing, Redis caching). Type classification moved from Hermes to Sophia via embedding centroids, which is architecturally correct (the cognitive core owns type semantics, not the language service). **Next**: feedback processing, multi-turn memory, context quality improvements.

### 2. Grounded perception via JEPA -- PAUSED
PoC exists in sophia (#76) with tests, docs, and backend integration. Last activity Dec 2025 -- stale but substantial. No blockers; needs prioritization to resume.

### 3. Flexible ontology -- MOSTLY DONE
Core reified model landed (logos #490). Type classification via centroids working (sophia #129, logos #494). Hermes aligned (hermes #84, #86). CWM-E persona entries seeded as state nodes (logos #495). **Remaining**: update stale downstream queries (#458, #460, #461, #462), implement capability catalog (#465), planning test updates (#464, blocked).

### 4. Memory and learning -- NOT STARTED
Spec exists (logos #415). Sub-issues (#411--#414) defined but not started. Depends on CWM unification (#496) as prerequisite.

### 5. CWM unification -- NOT STARTED
Ticket created (logos #496). logos_cwm_e and logos_persona use raw Cypher with stale ontology patterns. Need to become ontology-level type definitions consumed via HCG client. Prerequisite for memory work.

### 6. Planning and execution -- IN PROGRESS
HCGPlanner exists with backward-chaining over REQUIRES/CAUSES edges. Planner stub (#403) still coexists with real implementation. Process node structure defined but needs maturation as Talos develops.

### 7. Embodiment via Talos -- EARLY STAGE
Simulation scaffold exists. Last substantive work was standardization (talos #53--#55, Feb). Path to physics-backed simulation documented but not started. Depends on cognitive loop maturity.

### 8. Observability -- GOOD COVERAGE
OTel instrumentation landed across all services (logos #486, sophia #121, hermes #79, apollo #156). **Remaining gaps**: Apollo SDK integration (#340), Hermes/Sophia endpoint-level spans (#335, #338), testing & docs (#339, #342), persistent telemetry storage (#312).

### 9. Documentation -- IN PROGRESS
Proposed replacement docs exist in `docs/proposed_docs/`. Manifest (`DOC_MANIFEST.md`) defines the cleanup plan. Project tracking conventions (`PROJECT_TRACKING.md`) and vision (`VISION.md`) now in place. PM agent landed (logos #497). **Remaining**: execute manifest, per-repo cleanup, consolidation (#447).

### 10. Testing and infrastructure -- GOOD BASELINE
Test suites pass across repos with real infrastructure. Foundry v0.6.0 tagged with v0.5.0+ aligned across repos. CI reusable workflows tagged at ci/v1. **Remaining**: logos coverage improvement (#420), test conventions standardization, OpenAPI contract tests (#91), centralize test seeder (#481), centralize Redis infra (#469).

## Stale / Drift

### Stale Issues (>30 days since last activity)
- sophia #101: Define session boundaries and ephemeral node lifecycle (last activity: Dec 31)
- sophia #76: Implement JEPA PoC backend (last activity: Dec 6) -- substantial work exists, needs review or re-prioritization

### Unlinked PRs
Most recent PRs merged without closing issues. This is expected during the rapid development sprint and reflects the ticket discipline gap that prompted the PM agent initiative (logos #497). Going forward, PRs should reference issues per `docs/PROJECT_TRACKING.md`.

### Issues In-Progress With No Open PR
None detected -- clean.

### Foundry Version Drift
Hermes is at logos-foundry v0.6.0; sophia, apollo, and talos remain at v0.5.0. This is expected short-term but should be reconciled.
