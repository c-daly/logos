LOGOS Planner Stub Service

This is a minimal stub implementation of the Sophia Planner component.
It provides a callable API for plan generation without requiring the full
Sophia cognitive core implementation.

This stub is used in M3/M4 tests to validate planning concepts and integration
without requiring a complete planning implementation.
