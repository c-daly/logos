  ✓ Found 2 state(s):

  State 1:
  UUID: state-arm-home-01
  Name: ArmHomeState
  Timestamp: 2025-11-19 13:44:33.624000+00:00

  State 2:
  UUID: state-robot-arm-01-initial
  Name: RobotArm01-Idle
  Timestamp: 2025-11-19 13:39:13.442000+00:00

2.3 Get current/most recent state:
  ✓ Current state:
  UUID: state-arm-home-01
  Name: ArmHomeState
  Timestamp: 2025-11-19 13:44:33.624000+00:00
